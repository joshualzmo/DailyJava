# Day 08 — Password

## Topic
In today's program I practice input validation and manipulating the primitive data type 'char'. I also learned how 
to implement try-catch blocks, as well as the wrapper class Character.

## Description
This program stores a password with specific requirements such as a minimum length of eight, at least one upercase letter and
at least one number.

## Concepts Used
- Classes & objects
- For loops
- Try/Catch

## What I Learned
I leanred the class 'String' has seperate methods that can only be used on instances of that class.
For primitive data types like char, I must use wrapper classes.

## How to Run
1. Compile the file(s)
2. Run the main class
