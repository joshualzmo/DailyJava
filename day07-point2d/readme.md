# Day 07 — Point2D

## Topic
In today's program, I practiced overloading the existing 'equals' method that 
java taking in an object parameter and checking whether it is an instance of
Point2D.

## Description
This program simulates a cartesian plan by creating a Point2D object and assigning them 
x and y coordinates. fromOrigin method allows user to check the object's distance from 
the origin (0,0).

## Concepts Used
- Classes & objects
- instanceof
- Typecasting 
- Overloading 

## What I Learned
- I learned how to overload already existing java methods.
- I learned how to typecast objects.
- I learned a new part of the 'Math' class.

## How to Run
1. Compile the file(s)
2. Run the main class
