# Day 01 — Student

## Topic
Today in my 'Student' class I practiced initializing instance variables, creating a constructor, creating getter 
and setter methods, and a toString method. As an extension, I made sure to validate the the 'id' input and the 'grade'
input using exceptions. Although this is something we have not explicitly learned in class, I felt it was necessary 
to create a cohesive program.

## Description
This program prints components of an object created through the 'Student' class.

## Concepts Used
- Classes & objects
- Exceptions 
- IF statements

## What I Learned
- How to initialize a constructor
- How to use exceptions
- How to change a int to a string 

## How to Run
1. Compile the file(s)
2. Run the main class

# Daily Java Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of **daily Java mini-projects** created as part of a personal practice plan aligned with **CS 1027B – Computer Science Fundamentals II**.

The goal of this repository is to build consistency, reinforce core Java concepts, and develop strong intuition through short, focused projects completed in **under one hour each**.

---

## Structure

Each folder represents **one day of practice** and contains a small, self-contained Java project.


Each daily folder typically includes:
- One or more `.java` files
- A short `README.md` describing the project

---

## Topics Covered

Projects are completed in chronological order following the course progression, including:
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, encapsulation)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Exceptions and debugging
- Abstract Data Types (lists, stacks, queues)
- Linked data structures
- Recursion
- Trees and sorting algorithms

---

## Purpose

- Reinforce lecture and lab material through daily practice  
- Improve problem-solving speed and confidence in Java  
- Create a long-term reference for exams and future courses  

This repository is for **personal learning and practice only**.

---

## How to Run a Project

1. Navigate to a specific day’s folder
2. Compile the Java files
3. Run the main class (if applicable)

Example:
```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
