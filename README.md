# Daily Java Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of **daily Java mini-projects** created as part of a personal practice plan aligned with **CS 1027B – Computer Science Fundamentals II**.

The goal of this repository is to build consistency, reinforce core Java concepts, and develop strong intuition through short, focused projects completed in **under one hour each**.

---

## Structure

Each folder represents **one day of practice** and contains a small, self-contained Java project.


Each daily folder typically includes:
- One or more `.java` files
- A short `README.md` describing the project

---

## Topics Covered

Projects are completed in chronological order following the course progression, including:
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, encapsulation)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Exceptions and debugging
- Abstract Data Types (lists, stacks, queues)
- Linked data structures
- Recursion
- Trees and sorting algorithms

---

## Purpose

- Reinforce lecture and lab material through daily practice  
- Improve problem-solving speed and confidence in Java  
- Create a long-term reference for exams and future courses  

This repository is for **personal learning and practice only**.

## How to Run a Project

1. Navigate to a specific day’s folder
2. Compile the Java files
3. Run the main class (if applicable)

Example:
```bash
