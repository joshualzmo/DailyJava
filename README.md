# Day 01 — Student

## Topic
Today in my 'Student' class I practiced initializing instance variables, creating a constructor, creating getter 
and setter methods, and a toString method. As an extension, I made sure to validate the the 'id' input and the 'grade'
input using exceptions. Although this is something we have not explicitly learned in class, I felt it was necessary 
to create a cohesive program.

## Description
This program prints components of an object created through the 'Student' class.

## Concepts Used
- Classes & objects
- Exceptions 
- IF statements

## What I Learned
- How to initialize a constructor
- How to use exceptions
- How to change a int to a string 

## How to Run
1. Compile the file(s)
2. Run the main class
