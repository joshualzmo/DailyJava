# Day XX — School

## Topic
Today I practiced store the objects of a class in an array of a different class. I used 
for loops, exceptions, and if else statements to create this program. 

## Description
This program initialized 'Scholar' objects that act as students with attributes "name", "id", "average". 
The School class acts as a classroom where users can find the class average and the highest average.

## Concepts Used
- Classes & objects
- Encapusulation
- For loops 
- If/else statement

## What I Learned
I learned how to use code between to seperate classes to create one cohesive program. 
I also learned how to store object in an array.

## How to Run
1. Compile the file(s)
2. Run the main class
