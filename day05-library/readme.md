## Topic
In today's program, I practiced manipulating an array of objects by keeping track of null 
index and by verifying input accordingly.

class. Users can add/remove books, as well as print the entrie library.

## Concepts Used
- Classes & objects

## What I Learned
I learned how to properly keep track of null indexes in arrays. I also practiced input
validation using branching.
